# Computer+ — the improved melee AI

Warcraft III ships one melee computer, and we ship a port of it: four JASS scripts on a JASS
library on about 150 engine natives, transcribed function for function
([`melee-ai.md`](melee-ai.md)). It is the reference, and it is also — by every account since
2002, including issue #124's — an *unpleasant first opponent*: the easy computer still expands,
still towers, still masses, and still runs a build order a new player cannot answer.

**Computer+ is a second player sitting at the same controls.** Not a difficulty slider on the
first one: a different strategy layer, a different army manager, a different spell chooser and a
different set of manners, seated per slot by a checkbox in Advanced Options.

## The one-paragraph shape of it

| Layer | Classic melee AI | Computer+ |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Strategy | four transcribed scripts, ~650 lines each | ONE build routine + four data tables ([`plan.ts`](../src/ai/plus/plan.ts), [`races.ts`](../src/ai/plus/races.ts)) |
| Difficulty | 40 `!= MELEE_NEWBIE` guards scattered across five files, plus two engine cheats | one table, [`profile.ts`](../src/ai/plus/profile.ts) |
| Army | `common.ai`'s captain: a muster list, one wave at a time | one group, food-capped at production, with defend/attack/retreat states |
| Spells | one hiveworkshop thread, transcribed ([`casting.ts`](../src/ai/casting.ts)) | roles + a priority ladder + target value ([`plus/casting.ts`](../src/ai/plus/casting.ts)) |
| Manners | none | glhf, gg, and it leaves |
| Library / natives | [`aiPlayer.ts`](../src/ai/aiPlayer.ts) | **the same file** |

The bottom row is the important one. `AiPlayer` is the census, the build array, `OneBuildLoop`'s
gold priority, structure placement, the harvest plan, town bookkeeping and hero skills — none of
which is a *strategy*, all of which both AIs need, and all of which is Blizzard's own design.
Computer+ keeps it and replaces everything above it.

## It does not cheat

The classic INSANE computer gets exactly two things, and neither is skill:

* it is **paid twice** for every load its workers carry home (`INSANE_HARVEST_FACTOR`);
* it **ignores the fog of war** (`AiPlayer.knows`).

Computer+ takes **neither, at any difficulty**. `ComputerPlusAi.add` sets
`AiPlayer.bypassFog = false`, and `RtsController.startMeleeAIFor` returns before the harvest
bonus for a Computer+ seat. Every difference between its three rungs is a number in
`PlusProfile`, and every one of those numbers is something a *human* varies.

That is also why Computer+ has a **scout** and the classic AI does not: with no fog cheat,
walking a worker past the enemy's base is the only way it can ever learn about an expansion
(`AiPlayer.enemyExpansion` is gated on `knows`). One worker, one tour, not replaced when it dies.

## The difficulties, and what each one gives up

Everything below is in [`profile.ts`](../src/ai/plus/profile.ts). **None of it is Warcraft III's**
— nothing in the install describes an improved AI, so unlike the race scripts (where a number is
Blizzard's unless a comment says otherwise) every value here is ours.

| | Easy | Normal | Insane |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| build / army / spell pass | 3 s / 3 s / 2 s | 2 s / 1.5 s / 1 s | 1 s / 0.5 s / 0.35 s |
| notices a base attack after | **15 s** | 6 s | 1 s |
| waits this long into a fight before casting | 2.5 s | 1 s | 0 |
| workers per town | 8 | 11 | 14 |
| expansions | **never** | 1, after 10 min | 3, after 5 min |
| **army food ceiling** | **12** | 30 | 80 (`UPKEEP_TIER2`) |
| towers | **0** | 2 | 4 |
| heroes | 1 | 2 | 3 |
| hall tier | **1** | 2 | 3 |
| upgrade rank | 1 | 2 | 3 |
| first attack | 7 min | 5 min | 2½ min |
| army food that makes a wave | 10 | 14 | 16 |
| retreats a broken army | **no** | at 35 % | at 40 % |
| focus-fires / creeps / raids workers | no / no / no | no / yes / no | yes / yes / yes |
| spell roles it uses | heal, nuke, summon, morph | + panic, disable, buff | all nine |

Read the Easy column as a description of a player: it makes eight workers and six food of
tier-1 soldiers, never expands, never towers, never leaves its Town Hall, comes to find you
after seven minutes, feeds its army in one piece, and takes fifteen seconds to notice you are in
its base. That is issue #124's brief — "must essentially be able to be beaten by players who have
played MOBAs" — written as numbers.

### The army ceiling is enforced at PRODUCTION

`armyFood` is the single most load-bearing number, and *where* it is applied is the whole point.
It is a budget spent down the race's unit mix inside `buildPlan`, so an easy computer **asks for
twelve food of soldiers and then stops asking**. Capping the size of the *wave* instead would
have produced an AI that builds twenty Grunts, attacks with six, and still has twenty Grunts
standing when you walk into its base — which is exactly what "must NOT mass armies at all" rules
out.

## The build plan: one routine, four tables

A melee opening is the same game in four vocabularies, so [`plan.ts`](../src/ai/plus/plan.ts) is
one routine and [`races.ts`](../src/ai/plus/races.ts) is four tables of ids, weights and gates.
The block ORDER in `buildPlan` is the strategy, because `OneBuildLoop` reserves gold down the
list **and returns at the first unit row it cannot afford**:

> hall → workers → food → altar & barracks → heroes → **core army** → tech buildings → tier →
> towers → upgrades → expansion → **the rest of the army**

Four rules run through it. The first two are the library's own behaviour; the last two are what
that behaviour does to a naive ordering, and both were found by watching a match rather than by
reasoning about the code:

1. **Nothing is asked for that cannot be built.** A row's gold is reserved whether or not the row
   could start, so a row whose producer is missing silently starves everything under it. Every
   army/tech row is therefore gated on its producer *standing*.
2. **Counts are absolute** (`SetBuildUnit(n, X)` is "have at least n"), which is what lets the mix
   re-balance itself as tech opens up: the Footman row that asked for six at tier 1 asks for
   three once Knights are in the mix, and the six standing Footmen satisfy it.
3. **Workers and army rows use the RELATIVE form** (`SetBuildNext` — "one more than is
   finished"). `SetBuildUnit(12, PEON)` on a player who owns five reserves *seven peons' worth*,
   nine hundred gold, and starves everything under it: measured, an orc Computer+ reached three
   minutes with twelve peons, no hero and one Grunt.
4. **The bulk of the army goes LAST, and a small core goes high.** There are always more army
   rows than gold, so army rows in the middle mean nothing below them ever runs — measured, an
   insane orc reached seven minutes with no Stronghold and eleven hundred unspent lumber. The
   support buildings also come *before* the tier-up, because the tier-up is the row the AI
   genuinely saves for and a saved-for row blocks what is under it: a Forge is two hundred gold
   and makes the army you already have better, a Stronghold is seven hundred. This is the same
   shape `human.ai` has — "minimum melee defense" near the top, the tech tree in the middle, and
   "full up with more troops in general" at the bottom.

The ids are Blizzard's (`src/ai/ids.ts` is `common.ai`'s own globals block) and so is every
research location (`Researches=` in `Units\<Race>UnitFunc.txt`). The *composition* — which units,
in what proportion, in what order — is ours, following the standard ladder openings.

## Spells: roles, not a table of abilities

The classic caster refuses any ability its source thread does not describe, and names the
transform family as its one blanket exclusion. Issue #124 asks for the opposite — "it must
utilize ALL abilities, especially things like Bear Form" — so
[`plus/casting.ts`](../src/ai/plus/casting.ts) is built the other way up:

1. every ability has a **role** (`panic`, `heal`, `morph`, `disable`, `nuke`, `summon`, `buff`,
   `debuff`, `utility`), from a table for the melee races and **derived from the ability's own
   row** for anything else — so a custom map's spells are played rather than ignored;
2. the roles are a **priority ladder**, and a caster presses its most valuable legal button
   rather than the first one on its command card. A Paladin with a dying Footman in range heals
   before he stuns;
3. **targets are valued**, not counted: a hero is worth four soldiers and a spellcaster two and a
   half; a nuke goes on the one that is nearly dead and a disable on the healthiest one; an area
   spell lands where the most *value* is, not where the most bodies are;
4. a **reaction delay** keeps a spell from landing before a human could have pressed it, and a
   smaller role vocabulary keeps a novice from using half the card at all.

Legality is still the sim's — `castUseError` / `castError`, the click-time gates — so Computer+
can never be more permissive than the button a player presses.

**Bear Form was not implemented at all**, which is how issue #124's example turned into a sim
change: `[Abrf]` (and `[Arav]`, Raven Form) were missing from `KNOWN_ABILITIES`, so
`buildInitialAbilities` dropped the row, the button never appeared, and a Druid of the Claw could
not reach the body it exists to fight in. Both are the ordinary morph shape — `DataA1` names the
normal unit, `UnitID1` the alternate — so enabling them was two table rows and two handlers over
the `morphToggle` that already existed. See [`spell-fx.md`](spell-fx.md) for the presentation
side and `SimWorld.morphToggle` for the mechanism.

There is one button on a BUILDING, and it is very human: **Call to Arms**. `Amic` is the Human
town bell, and it is the answer to "something is in my base and my army is somewhere else" —
which is the situation an AI is worst at. Rung only when the raiders outnumber whatever is home,
and never on Easy.

## Manners: glhf, gg, and leaving

Two things the classic AI never does, both asked for by the issue, and both deliberately plain —
AMAI gives its bots invented names and a joke book, and issue #124 rules out both in as many
words. Six lines of ladder shorthand, drawn off the AI's own RNG stream, spoken by whatever the
lobby already calls that slot.

The lines go out through the **ordinary chat path** (`RtsController.onChatSaid` →
`MapViewerScene.deliverChat`), so a computer's "glhf" is routed, tagged, coloured, logged and
relayed to LAN clients exactly like a typed one, and a map with a chat trigger sees it.

### Conceding, without demolishing the base

`hopeless()` is deliberately conservative — three clauses that each mean "there is no route back
from here" — and the position has to *stay* hopeless for `concedeAfter` seconds (45 on Easy, 20
on Insane: a weaker player takes longer to accept it). Then it says gg, waits five seconds, and
**leaves**.

Leaving is `EVENT_PLAYER_LEAVE`, raised on the map's own script:

```
ComputerPlusAi → PlusHost.leave → RtsController.onPlayerLeft
                → MapViewerScene → interp.firePlayerEvent(player, EVENT_PLAYER_LEAVE)
                → Blizzard.j MeleeTriggerActionPlayerLeft
                   ├ ShareEverythingWithTeam  (if an ally is still alive)
                   └ MakeUnitsPassiveForTeam  (otherwise — units go to Neutral Passive)
                   → MeleeDoLeave → MeleeCheckForLosersAndVictors
```

This is the one thing issue #124 explicitly asks us **not** to copy from AMAI: "when the AI
leaves it destroys its buildings, which shouldn't be happening in our case". AMAI has no choice —
a JASS script's only way to end its own player is to satisfy the defeat condition, and the defeat
condition is *your team owns no structures*. We are not constrained that way, because the engine
is ours: raising the event runs Blizzard's own leave path, which hands the units over rather than
killing them, and the victory that follows is the map's own ruling rather than ours.

Note what this depends on: `MeleeInitVictoryDefeat` must have run, i.e. it is a melee map with a
melee init trigger. On a map that never registered the event the concession is still said and the
AI still stops playing — it simply stands there, like a player who alt-tabbed.

## The UI, and the overrides layer

Two new controls, neither of which the 2003 UI has a frame for. They are **not** added by editing
the install — `UI\FrameDef\` is the player's and OpenWar3 ships zero Blizzard assets — but by a
layer of our own FrameDef files in [`src/overrides/`](../src/overrides/), applied at mount through
`mountFdfScreen`'s `overrides` option. Read that directory's README before adding a third.

* **Custom Game → Advanced Options → "Computer+ (Improved AI):"** — one switch for the whole
  match. Flipping it also swaps what every computer row's NAME menu offers, so the slots read
  "Computer+ (Easy) / (Normal) / (Insane)" (`slotOptionsFor` in `ui/playerSlots.ts`).
* **Options → Gameplay → "Use Computer+ as default AI"** — the remembered default of that switch.
  It arrives in the row vacated by **Game Port** and **Chat Support**, both of which are retired
  by the same override: there is no port to set (a LAN game here is a WebRTC relay) and no
  Battle.net chat gateway to choose.

The LAN game lobby keeps the classic three. It has no Advanced Options pane, and the choice is
the match's rather than the row's.

## Where it runs, and how to reach it

Authority-side only, from `RtsController.tick`, inside the branch a frozen LAN client never
enters — and every decision leaves as a `Command` through `RtsController.execute`, the same door
and the same ownership/cost/tech/food judgement a human player's click gets.

It is seated at exactly the same seam as the classic AI: `MeleeStartingAI` → `StartMeleeAI` →
`RtsController.startMeleeAIFor`, which reads the seat's own `plus` flag and hands it to one of the
two objects. So the map still decides who plays and as what; a campaign chapter and a
use-map-settings map get no Computer+ for the same reason they get no classic AI.

```
?dev&map=EchoIsles&ai=plus-easy       # …&ai=plus-normal, &ai=plus-insane
```

…or the real screen: Custom Game → pick a map → **Advanced Options** → tick **Computer+**.
