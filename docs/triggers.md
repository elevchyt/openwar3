## TL;DR — current status

| Milestone | What | Status | How it's checked |
|---|---|---|---|
| 7.0 | JASS lexer + parser | ✅ done | parses `common.j` + `blizzard.j` + **all 165** bundled `war3map.j`, 0 errors |
| 7.1 | Interpreter core + `config()` | ✅ done | config() players/start-locations == `war3map.w3i` (oracle) |
| 7.2 | `CreateUnit` + world bring-up | ✅ done (headless) | `CreateAllUnits()` count == `war3mapUnits.doo` (PlunderIsle 82==82) |
| — | **Vision on custom maps** (issue #33 bug) | ✅ done (live) | pre-placed player units seeded owned → fog lifts (screenshots) |
| 7.2b | live `CreateUnit` → new sim units (replace .doo adoption) | ⬜ next | — |
| 7.3 | Melee from the script (retire hard-coded roster) | ⬜ todo | melee-via-script == `startMelee` |
| 7.4 | Trigger/event runtime (pump events from the sim tick) | ⬜ todo | a scripted trigger fires in-game |
| 7.5 | Native breadth + Lua/Reforged | ⬜ ongoing | `pnpm jass:coverage` |

Run the checks any time: **`pnpm jass:test`** (7.0–7.2 oracles) and **`pnpm jass:coverage`** (unimplemented natives by usage).

## How WC3 runs a map (the model we implement)

A `.w3x`/`.w3m` map file is a renamed **MPQ archive**. The World Editor compiles every trigger — whether authored
in the GUI or hand-written JASS — into **one script the engine actually runs**:

- **`war3map.j`** — JASS (our target, 1.27a). *(`war3map.lua` on Reforged — deferred.)*
- The GUI files `war3map.wtg` (trigger tree) and `war3map.wct` (custom text) are **editor-only** — the game never
  reads them. So "run a map's triggers" = run the compiled `war3map.j`.

The script is layered on two Blizzard libraries shipped in the game MPQs (read from the user's own install, never
vendored — see the legal boundary in `CLAUDE.md`):

- **`Scripts\common.j`** — 1160 **native** declarations + 91 handle **types** + constants. Natives are the engine
  primitives (`CreateUnit`, `SetPlayerColor`, …) we implement in JS.
- **`Scripts\blizzard.j`** — 923 JASS **functions** built on the natives (the `…BJ` helpers + the `Melee*` library).
  We *interpret* these — we don't reimplement them.

The engine calls two entry points, then pumps events:

```
config()   // SetPlayers/SetTeams/DefineStartLocation/InitCustomPlayerSlots — player + map setup
main()
  SetCameraBounds / SetDayNightModels / sound  (we no-op — the renderer owns these)
  CreateAllUnits()             // CreateUnit(...) per pre-placed unit (mirrors war3mapUnits.doo)
  InitBlizzard() / InitGlobals() / InitCustomTriggers() / RunInitializationTriggers()
// then: registered triggers fire on unit/player/region/timer events (milestone 7.4)
```

## Architecture — `src/jass/`

A clean, self-contained interpreter with a thin bridge to our engine. **The interpreter never imports the renderer
or vfs** (bridge, not fork) — so it's testable headlessly and stays engine-agnostic.

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `lexer.ts` | JASS tokens: keywords, idents, int/real/string literals, `'fourcc'` rawcodes (`rawcodeToInt`/`intToRawcode`), operators, significant newlines |
| `ast.ts` | node types (globals, native/function decls, set/call/if/loop/exitwhen/return, expressions) |
| `parser.ts` | recursive-descent → `JassProgram`. Precedence: `or` < `and` < comparisons < `+ -` < `* /` < unary |
| `values.ts` | value model — **int and real are separate kinds** (JASS `int/int` truncates!); handles, code refs, null; `defaultForType` |
| `runtime.ts` | handle table (interned player/enum handles), `MapSetup`, globals/arrays, function+native registries, seeded RNG, `EngineHooks` bridge |
| `interpreter.ts` | tree-walker: call frames, `and`/`or` **do not short-circuit** (JASS gotcha), type-directed arithmetic, safe defaults, loop/recursion caps |
| `natives/config.ts` | `config()` + player-setup natives → `MapSetup` |
| `natives/world.ts` | `CreateUnit` (+ bridge), resource/state setters, **floating text** (`CreateTextTag`…), `DisplayText…` |
| `natives/index.ts` | registry: enum constructors (`Convert*`), trigger core (`CreateTrigger`/`TriggerAddAction`/`ConditionalTriggerExecute`), utility natives (`I2S`, `GetRandomInt`, camera/env no-ops) |
| `headless.ts` | engine-free entry: `buildInterpreter(sources)` for tests/tooling |
| `index.ts` | **app-facing** loader: reads `common.j`/`blizzard.j`/`war3map.j` via the VFS, runs `config()` |

**Never hard-crash the map.** An unimplemented native falls back to a typed default from its `common.j` return type;
a missing function/variable logs once and returns null; runaway loops/recursion are capped. This is why a map that
uses natives we haven't written yet still runs as far as it can.

## The issue #33 vision bug — fixed

**Symptom:** on non-melee (custom) maps the whole map was fogged — you couldn't even see your own units.

**Cause:** `startCustom` seeded **no owned units** into the sim, and `updateVision` only reveals around the local
team's units — so nothing lifted the fog. The map's pre-placed player units rendered (the viewer draws
`war3mapUnits.doo`) but were neither owned nor simulated.

**Fix (`src/render/mapViewer.ts` `startCustom` + `src/game/rts.ts`):** adopt each pre-placed **player** unit
(owner 0–11) as an **owned, simulated** unit — reusing the viewer's already-rendered `.doo` instance (the same
instance-adoption `trySeed` does for creeps, so no double render). Teams come from `teamOf(owner)`, so the local
player's units share the local team and lift the fog; other slots' units exist too (world stays alive) but stay
fogged like any other player's. A seeding **gate** (`enableSeeding`) makes `trySeed` wait until start setup has
configured owners/teams, so no unit is adopted with stale data.

Verified live on WarChasers (`?dev` + agent-browser): local player owns its selector wisp, fog is lit around it and
black beyond; `config()` ran on the real script (5 players, 5 start locations); 278 player units seeded owned. Melee
(Echo Isles) unchanged: town hall + 5 workers + 91 creeps, fog correct.

> The live `startCustom` also runs the map's `config()` through the interpreter (read-only for now) — the first live
> use of the trigger engine on a real script, and the seam for running `main()`/triggers in 7.2b+.

## Verifying (do this after any trigger change)

- **`pnpm jass:test`** — compiles the pure interpreter (`tools/tsconfig.jass.json` → CJS in `.jass-build/`) and runs
  `tools/jass-corpus-test.cjs`:
  - **7.0** every `war3map.j` (+ common.j/blizzard.j) parses with zero errors — permanent regression gate.
  - **7.1** `config()` start-locations == `war3map.w3i` on PlunderIsle (2) and WarChasers (5).
  - **7.2** `CreateAllUnits()` count == `war3mapUnits.doo` (PlunderIsle 82==82; WarChasers ~321 vs 334, diff = units
    the map spawns from triggers / non-unit `.doo` entries — expected until 7.4).
- **`pnpm jass:coverage`** — `tools/native-coverage.mjs`: of common.j's 1160 natives, **335 are used** across the 165
  bundled maps; prints them ranked by #maps, with a `✓` for the ones we've implemented. Pick the next batch from the
  top of the unimplemented list.
- **Live** (custom-map behaviour): drive the app per the `live-browser-testing` workflow (temp `?dev=` auto-mount +
  `agent-browser`), load a scenario map, confirm your own units are visible and fog behaves.

Reads only the developer's own local install (`Warcraft III/` is gitignored; we ship zero Blizzard assets).

  behaviour. Always verify against them (`CLAUDE.md` prime directive).

  interpreting trigger semantics (floating text, regions, etc.). Indexed in [`REFERENCES.md`](REFERENCES.md).
- **[W3X file format spec](https://867380699.github.io/blog/2019/05/09/W3X_Files_Format)** — the binary layout of the

## What's NOT done yet (next tasks — keep this list honest)

- **7.2b** route live unit creation through `CreateUnit` (currently the vision fix adopts `.doo` instances; the
  interpreter's `CreateUnit` runs headless only).
- **7.3** run melee from `blizzard.j`'s `Melee*` library and retire the hard-coded `startMelee` roster.
- **7.4** the event runtime: pump `TriggerRegister*Event` from the sim tick, set event responses
  (`GetTriggerUnit`, `GetEnteringUnit`, …), fire conditions/actions. This is what makes floating-text-on-event,
  region triggers, victory conditions, and full custom maps actually *play*.
- **Natives on demand** — regions/groups/forces, timers, weather, sound, cameras, cinematics, multiboard, gamecache.
  Use `pnpm jass:coverage` to prioritise.
- **Lua** (`war3map.lua`, Reforged 1.31+) — only when we target that version.
