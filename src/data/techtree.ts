// The tech tree — WC3's own, read from the game's own files (issue #57).
//
// None of this lives in the SLKs. UnitMetaData.slk's `slk` column names the file each
// field is written to, and every tech field (`ureq` Requires, `utra` Trains, `ures`
// Researches, `ubui` Builds, `uupt` Upgrade, `usei` Sellitems, `useu` Sellunits, `umki`
// Makeitems, `udep` DependencyOr) says **Profile** — i.e. the per-race `*UnitFunc.txt`
// INI. The same three fields sit on upgrades (`*UpgradeFunc.txt`) and items
// (`ItemFunc.txt`), with identical semantics, so ONE graph covers all three id spaces
// and `requirements()` answers for a unit, an upgrade or a shop item alike.
//
// This replaces the old hand-curated WORKER_BUILDS/BUILDING_TRAINS tables. They were
// right — `[hpea] Builds=htow,hhou,hbar,hbla,hwtw,halt,harm,hars,hlum,hgra,hvlt` is
// exactly the list that was typed out by hand — but they carried no requirements, and
// the other three races had to be transcribed by hand. Reading the profiles gives every
// race its real build/train/research lists AND its gating for free.
