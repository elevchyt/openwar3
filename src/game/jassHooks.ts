 *
 * So mines are handed out as `MINE_ID_BASE + mine.id` and recognised on the way back in. The
 * base lives here, with the bridge that invents it, because five natives and the renderer's

// `simWorld` escape hatch: 66 of the 70 remaining `simWorld` uses in mapViewer.ts are JASS natives
// mutating the authoritative world from a file whose job is to draw. The interpreter runs on the
// AUTHORITY, once (docs/multiplayer.md "JASS"), so a headless host needs a hook table — and today
// one can only be built by something holding a WebGL context.
//
// Everything here needs `SimWorld` and NOTHING else: no renderer, no DOM, no registries, no
// `RtsController`. That is the whole selection rule, and it is why this file compiles standalone.
// The entries that did NOT come across are the ones whose bodies genuinely read something else,
// and each is a different reason rather than one:
//
//   * `getUnitX`/`getUnitY`/`getResourceAmount`/`createBlightedGoldMine` fall back to the gold-mine
//     table, which is map-placement state the renderer owns.
//   * `createUnit`/`removeUnit`/`killUnit`/`issueUnitOrder` route through `RtsController`, which
//     owns spawning and the order funnel.
//   * selection, camera, sound, weather, effects, text and the registries are presentation by
//     nature and belong to whoever is drawing.
//
// The player-resource pair (`setPlayerState`/`getPlayerState`) is NOT here either, and for a
// third reason again: their answer is the authority's rather than the raw world's. They live in
// `authorityHooks` at the bottom of this file.
//
// Composition is a spread: every `EngineHooks` member is optional, so the renderer merges this
// table with its own and the compiler still checks both halves against the same interface.
//
// `teamOf` is the one thing the world half cannot answer for itself. `SetUnitOwner` has to write
// a TEAM alongside the new owner — the sim decides allegiance and vision by team, not by slot —
// and the slot→team seating is the LOBBY's, which the world does not carry. It is injected rather
// than looked up so that both callers can supply the mapping they actually have: the renderer
// passes its `meleeTeams` lookup, a headless host passes `MeleeConfig.slots`. See item 1c-note in
// docs/multiplayer.md — that this mapping has no authority-side owner at all is a real finding,

// The natives about who can SEE what, and who counts as whose ally (docs/multiplayer.md

//
// These were the largest block still routed through `RtsController`, and the reason given was
// that the fog-modifier registry had to stay there: modifier ids are one global handle space
// shared with JASS, so N viewpoints minting their own would collide. That is true — and it is an
// argument against putting the registry on a `Viewpoint`, not against putting it on the
// `VisionSet`, which is a single object that owns all of them. Once it moved there, nothing in
// this group needed a controller at all.
//
// `cripplePlayer` and `setFogState` are stated in terms of a RECIPIENT rather than "local", which
// is what Phase D item 4 already fixed inside the set; this just stops routing them through an
// object that also holds a camera.
